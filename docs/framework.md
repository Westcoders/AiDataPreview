## Learn how to organize frameworks

1. 
i have a `chatdata` web project consisting of a `server` folder and `client` folder. In `server` folder, I build a api backend server in `python` code where the `fastapi` and `uvicorn` package are used. and in `client` folder, i bulid a frontend website by `node, npm, pnpm, html, vue, js`.

Now the `server` of  `chatdata` project is implemention by python async function , but it only single user access. when there are multiple user access, it will response same content for all user. How do you extend this project to one that responds independently to multiple usersï¼Ÿ

2. How to transform this project into a multi-user independent response content project based on the current framework (front-end: fastapi, uvicorn, etc.; back-end vue, etc., as described above)
